    <string name="desc_turbo">A turbocharger is a turbine driven, forced induction device that is utilised in a piston engine to enable it to produce more power. This increase in air and fuel results in the turbocharged engine being more powerful and efficient than its naturally aspirated counterpart.</string>
    <string name="desc_ccover">A compressor cover includes a compressor inlet duct and an inlet for a compressor wheel. The compressor cover includes at least one appendix positioned between an upstream portion of the compressor inlet duct and the compressor wheel inlet.</string>
    <string name="desc_bhousing">Bearing housings are modular assemblies designed to make it easy to install bearings and shafts, while protecting bearings, extending their operating life and simplifying maintenance.</string>
    <string name="desc_splate">The Seal Plate, also known as a back plate or insert plate is where the front seal is generally seated. Made mainly of aluminium, these components MUST be very precise in dimensions to ensure a perfect clearance is found between surrounding components to ensure the perfect seal.</string>
    <string name="desc_piston">Piston is a disk or short cylinder fitting closely within a tube in which it moves up and down against a liquid or gas, used in an internal combustion engine to derive motion, or in a pump to impart motion.</string>
